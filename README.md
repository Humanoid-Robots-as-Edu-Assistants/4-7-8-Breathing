# "4-7-8-Breathing" for NAO robot [v.1.0]
*This project is available in german and english, with an additional possibility of continuation in german, in case the same exercise is done multiple times with the same group.*<br>

### About

The 4-7-8 breathing exercise is a more in-depth breathing exercise, in which the participants are asked <br>
to breathe in a specific rhythm. For example they have to inhale four seconds, holding the breath for seven <br>
seconds and exhaling for eight seconds. Accordingly, it is more appropriate for bigger breaks or more intense <br>
relaxation sessions. NAO guides the participants all the way through and signals each phase verbally while <br>
moving his limbs and changing his eye colour.

### How the program works

After a short introduction, NAO asks for a starting input which can be given either verbally or by pressing <br>
one of NAOs foot bumpers. The exercise begins and lasts for four cycles. In the english version, the user has <br>
the option to repeat the exercise for another three cycles.

### What do you need?

You only need your NAO robot.

### Plans of further development:

We currently have no plans to further develop the program.
